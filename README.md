# MQTTBridge Examples

Two very simple Java applications that illustrate how Yoctopuces modules can be integrated into a MQTT architecture.

The subdirectory `mqtt_bridge_cmdline` is a simple command line application, and the `mqtt_bridge_websocket` is a web application that use WebSocket callback instead of direct connection.

For more explanations on how these examples works read this article on our web site : https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/article
